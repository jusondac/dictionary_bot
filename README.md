## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Bot doesn't respond**
   - Check if the bot is online in your server
   - Verify the bot has "Send Messages" permission
   - Make sure you're using the correct prefix (`!` by default for dictionary commands, `/` for game commands)

2. **"No definition found" errors**
   - Some words might not be in the dictionary API
   - Try alternative spellings or simpler words
   - The API works best with common English words

3. **Word Chain Game Issues**
   - "This is not a valid English word!" - The word wasn't found in the dictionary
   - "Not your turn!" - Wait for your turn in the player queue
   - Game not starting - Need at least 2 players to begin

4. **API rate limits**
   - The free APIs have rate limits
   - If using WordsAPI, check your RapidAPI dashboard for usage
   - Consider upgrading to paid plans for heavy usage

### Error Messages:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN is required` - Add your bot token to the `.env` file
- `Could not find definition` - Word not found in the dictionary
- `WordsAPI key not configured` - Add your WordsAPI key for enhanced features
- `This is not a valid English word!` - Submitted word failed dictionary validation in Word Chain
- `Word must start with "X"` - Word Chain game rule violation
- `This word has already been used!` - Word already used in current Word Chain game
